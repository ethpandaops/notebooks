## Question

Why was the block at slot 13505944 orphaned despite containing a valid-looking payload with 909 transactions and 21 blobs?

</Section>

<Section type="background">

## Background

On January 20, 2026 at 07:49:11 UTC, validator 715575 (**blockscape_lido**) proposed a block at slot 13505944. The block achieved only **0.46% head votes**.

The [slot overview](https://lab.ethpandaops.io/ethereum/slots/13505944?tab=timeline) showed a late block (~2.9s) with a heavy payload (60M gas, 21 blobs), but even late heavy blocks typically achieve far higher head accuracy.

## Investigation

### Head Vote Accuracy

Surrounding slots achieved 98-99% head accuracy. Slot 13505944 managed 0.46%.

<SqlSource source="xatu_cbt" query="stale_parent_head_accuracy" />

<ECharts config={headAccuracyConfig} height="400px" />

### Who Voted For It?

The only entity that voted for the block was all of the proposer's own operator's validators: **blockscape_lido**. This suggests that these validators were all running on the same node.

<SqlSource source="xatu_cbt" query="stale_parent_head_voters" />

<DataTable data={head_voters} />

### The Stale Parent

The proposed block's `parent_root` points to **slot 13505925** -- 19 slots behind the chain tip at slot 13505943.

| Field | Slot 13505944 (Proposed) | Expected (Canonical) |
|---|---|---|
| Beacon parent | Slot **13505925** | Slot 13505943 |
| Exec payload parent hash | `0xdbf1fc25...` (block 24274582) | `0xa113a54b...` (block 24274600) |
| Exec payload block number | **24274583** | 24274601 |

The proposer's node was stuck 19 slots (~3.8 minutes) behind the chain head. The block is valid on its own fork. However, the canonical chain has 19 slots of accumulated attestation weight that a single block cannot overcome.

```
Canonical chain at time of proposal:

  ... → 13505925 → 13505926 → ... → 13505943  (tip)
             ↑
             └── 13505944 built HERE (19 slots stale)
```

## Takeaways

- The proposer's node was stuck 19 slots behind the chain tip, building on slot 13505925 instead of 13505943
- The block is valid on its own fork, but fork choice could never prefer it over the canonical chain's 19 slots of accumulated weight
- **0.46% head accuracy** -- only 142 of 30,577 attestations voted for a block on a stale fork and all of them came from the proposer operator's own validators
