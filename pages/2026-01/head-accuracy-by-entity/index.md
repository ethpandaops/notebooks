## Question

Do community staking operators (Lido CSM, Rocketpool, Solo Stakers) see worse head vote accuracy as blob counts increase?

</Section>

<Section type="background">

## Background

Every slot, validators attest to what they believe is the current head of the chain. If a block arrives late or propagates slowly, attesters may vote for the *parent* block instead of the new one. This "incorrect" head vote isn't the attester's fault - they voted for what they saw.

**Head vote accuracy** measures how often these attestations match the canonical chain head. A lower accuracy typically indicates:
- Blocks arriving late at the attester's node
- Network propagation issues
- Infrastructure or connectivity problems

**Entity groups** compared in this investigation:
- **Lido CSM** - Community Staking Module operators (permissionless entry into Lido)
- **Rocketpool** - Decentralized staking protocol operators
- **Solo Stakers** - Independent home validators
- **Other** - Everyone else (professional operators, exchanges, etc.)

## Investigation

### When Attesting

When validators from each entity group attest, how often do they vote for the correct head? This reflects whether they're seeing blocks on time.

                fill: '#666'
            }
        }]
    }}
/>

### When Proposing

When each entity group proposes a block, how many attesters vote for it as head? This reflects how well their blocks propagate to the network.

            rotation: Math.PI / 2,
            style: {
                text: 'Head Vote Accuracy (%)',
                fontSize: 12,
                fill: '#666'
            }
        }]
    }}

<Section type="takeaways">

## Takeaways

- Solo stakers show comparable head vote accuracy to other entity groups at low blob counts
- As blob counts increase beyond ~20, all groups show declining accuracy, but the effect is more pronounced for home validators
- This suggests that high-blob blocks may propagate slower to residential connections
